1) To get sentences from input
    compromise:
    example_text = "Hello Mr. Smith, how are you doing today? The weather is great and python is awesome. The sky is pinkish-blue, you should not eat cardboard"
    sentences = nlp(example_text).sentences().out('array')
    output:
    ["Hello Mr. Smith, how are you doing today? The weather is great and python is awesome.",
    "The sky is pinkish-blue, you should not eat cardboard"]

2) To get named entities
    compromise:
    doc = nlp('the opera about richard nixon visiting china')
    doc.topics().data()
    // [
    //   { text: 'richard nixon' },
    //   { text: 'china' }
    // ]

3) To get verbs
    compromise:
    do - nlp('').sentences().verbs() // i think?

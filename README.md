# EscapeNLP

A text-based escape room web application for up to five player.
It uses natural language processing to interpret player inputs to understand their intentions (put chat messages into actions on the game board)

To play the game, join a lobby or create a lobby, then have every player inside the lobby press the ready button.

Once every player pressed the ready button and the game has started, players can now start doing actions by switching the chat mode to 'action' or by typing the delimiter '*' in front of every chat message when the chat mode is on 'chat'.

# EscapeNLP

A text-based escape room web application for up to five player.
It uses natural language processing to interpret player inputs to understand their intentions (put chat messages into actions on the game board)

To play the game, join a lobby or create a lobby, then have every player inside the lobby press the ready button.

Once every player pressed the ready button and the game has started, players can now start doing actions by switching the chat mode to 'action' or by typing the delimiter '*' in front of every chat message when the chat mode is on 'chat'.

# How to Install EscapeNLP
First, go ahead and clone this repository to your local machine by using the command 
```
git clone https://github.com/MariaVolpe/EscapeNLP.git
```

Once it has finished cloning to your local machine, go into the EscapeNLP directory by using the command
```
cd EscapeNLP/
```

Now that you are in the EscapeNLP, use the command 
```
npm install
```

Once that is finished, let's start up the server by using the command 
```
npm start
```

Now the server is up, but we still have to start up the game. Start by opening up another terminal window, while keeping the
terminal that was used to start up the server open,  and go back in the EscapeNLP directory. Now that you are the EscapeNLP
directory in the second terminal window, go into the client directory by using the command
```
cd client/
```

Now that you are in the EscapeNLP/client/, use the command 
```
npm install
```

Once that is finished, let's start up EscapeNLP by using the command 
```
npm start
```

Lastly... ENJOY THE GAME!
